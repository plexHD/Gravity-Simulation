# Gravity Simulation
 An attempt at a barely realistic simulation of gravitational forces objects have on each other.

Please bare in mind that this is just a simple project for fun and is soly based on 
physical equation. This means that while the simulations might look quite realistic, 
this is by no means a complex simulation and a lot of factors are not taken into account 
here. You might notice that it is also just in 2d, due to the limitations of pygame. 
Additionally this project is still work in progress and I might add more features
like a UI to manage planets and their respective positions and velocities, more realistic 
simulation and more.

Use the left and right arrow keys to control the speed of time. (Probably necessary to
make movements visible)

Should you wish to use the simulation or code in any form, you are free to do so, 
but some credit would be greatly appreciated (by Moritz Ramge), if made public.
