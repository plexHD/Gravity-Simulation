# Gravity Simulation
 An attempt at a barely realistic simulation of gravitational forces objects have on each other.

Please bare in mind that this is just a simple project for fun and is soly based on 
physical equations. This means that this is by no means a very accurate representation of reality, but rather based on our theoretical understanding of pyhsical concepts and a lot of factors are not taken into account here. You might notice that it is also just in 2d, due to the limitations of pygame.
To get started open the menu in the top right corner and start creating some objects.
With the quickload buttons at the bottom, you can easely load the sun, earth and mars and their respective orbits. When adding custom objects and planets, please note that it is very important, to enter the values unit and unit size.

Use the left and right arrow keys to control the speed of time. (Probably necessary to
make movements visible)

Should you wish to use the simulation or code in any form, you are free to do so, 
but some credit would be greatly appreciated (by Moritz Ramge), if made public.
